Instructions:  These tests are to express the variety of tasks you would perform in this job. Please complete all exercises.



Exercise 1
==========
Pick any scientific paper.  Write a short paragraph (8-10 sentences) in your own words describing the key experiments and conclusions from that publication.  Include a PDF of the paper you chose when you submit your exercises.

Exercise 2
==========
Read the following publication and its associated references.

Primary publication:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19814794

Related references:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17873876
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17392789
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19092803

Answer these questions in 1-2 pages:
* Where could we obtain each dataset?
* What would you do to compare results from these datasets?
* What types of errors are possible in these datasets?
* What validation we would need to perform on the data?   In other words, if you were a user of SGD and retrieved these data what would you assume was validated?
* What data would we make available?
* How could we display the individual datasets and the Pugh results?
* Where do you see issues and connections between these data and information already in SGD or other biological data?

Exercise 3
==========
Read the directions in the 'pileup-script-drections' document.  The 'BL6_x_Cast_RNA.pileup' contains the data to be analyzed.  Please provide your script and the results file.

Exercise 4
==========
The ENCODE Portal is based on a REST API.  This means that the information that the web page uses to create webpages is the same information you would get as programmatically querying the ENCODE database.  Any URL that is generated when you click on the Portal can be programmatically queried to get the information back in a parsable format. An introduction to the ENCODE Portal and the REST API are described in these help documents:

* Getting Started: https://www.encodeproject.org/help/getting-started
* The ENCODE REST API: https://www.encodeproject.org/help/rest-api/

For this exercise, write a script that queries the ENCODE database gives a tab-delimited results file for the following query:

"Give me the experiment accession, biosample, protein target, and number of replicates for all ChIP-seq assays released in August of 2012".


Please submit your script and results file.


Exercise 5
==========

Find data errors

Some background:
*  The left arm of chromosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are sequences left of the centromere.

* The genomic sequence (DNA) is annotated with different types of sequence features. A sequence feature is what role that particular stretch of DNA plays - a protein-coding gene, a tRNA, a centromere.  Sequence features can be on the Watson strand or the Crick strand of the genome.

* An ORF is a sequence feature that is defined as an Open Reading Frame.  It is a gene that is translated into a protein.

You've downloaded a file called "SGDFeaturesChrXI.xlsx" that contains ORFs from the left arm of chromosome 11.  However, you notice that there are several errors in the file.  The first row, highlighted in yellow, contains correctly formatted data. The subsequent rows may contains data errors.  Can you find them and describe why each is wrong?

You should expect to find the following types of information in the columns:

1.	Row number: use this when you refer to the rows with errors (mandatory)
2.   	Primary SGDID: a unique identifier for the sequence feature (mandatory)
3.   	Feature type: a phrase that describes the sequence feature   (mandatory)
4.   	Feature name: a name that describes the approximate location of the sequence feature (optional)
5.	Gene name: a human-friendly name, following the pattern of 3 letters and a number (optional)
6.   	Secondary SGDID: alternate identifiers for the sequence feature  (optional, multiples separated by |)
7.   	Chromosome: the chromosome that the sequence feature is located on (optional)
8.  	Start coordinate: the coordinate number on the chromosome that contains the beginning of the start codon (mandatory)
9.  	Stop coordinate: the coordinate number on the chromosome that  contains the end of the stop codon  (mandatory)
10.  	Strand: whether the ORF is on the Watson or Crick strand (mandatory)
11.  	Sequence version date: date when the genomic sequence was last modified (optional)
12.  	Description: A short summary of the biological role of the ORF (optional)

Problem 1:

Perform a benchmarking for the bam2pairs tool - we want to be able to determine how much memory and total space we would need to run this tool for any given input size, so that we can automate that process eventually. To aid such a goal, can you run this tool with inputs of varying sizes and collect the memory footprint and space used? Give us the result in the most useful format.

Bam2pairs converts a ‘bam’ file to a ‘pairs’ file and involves reading a bam file and sorting.
Bam2pairs : https://github.com/4dn-dcic/pairix/blob/master/util/bam2pairs/bam2pairs
BAM file format : https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf 
Pairs file format : https://github.com/4dn-dcic/pairix/blob/master/pairs_format_specification.md

Measuring memory : you can use /usr/bin/time (for Linux) or \time -l (Mac)

Problem 3:

The ENCODE Portal provides access to the data generated by the ENCODE consortium to interrogate functional elements in the human and mouse genomes. It provides a description of the biological samples and the experimental protocols, and an easy platform to download raw and processed files from these experiments.

The Portal is based on a REST API.  This means that the information that the web page uses to create webpages is the same information you would get as programmatically querying the ENCODE database.  Any URL that is generated when you click on the Portal can be programmatically queried to get the information back in a parsable format. An introduction to the ENCODE Portal and the REST API are described in these help documents:

* Getting Started: https://www.encodeproject.org/help/getting-started
* The ENCODE REST API: https://www.encodeproject.org/help/rest-api/

A ChIP-seq experiment aims to resolve where a specific protein is bound on DNA genomewide. It involves pulling down DNA with a specific antibody against the target protein and sequencing the pulled down DNA. When ChIP-seq experiments are performed, a control sample, with no antibody or a non-specific antibody, is also usually sequenced to determine various kinds of biases that may occur in the experiment. Raw sequencing results are given in .fastq format.

Some of these questions may be answered using the graphical user interface without a programatic approach.

1. write a script that queries the ENCODE database to give a tab-delimited results file for the following query:
"Give me the experiment accession, biosample, protein target, and number of replicates for all ChIP-seq assays released in August of 2012".
Please submit your script and results file.

2. HCT116 ChIP-seq IP and control files:
a. Describe how you would download all raw sequencing files for ChIP-seq assays done on HCT116 cell line.
b. What is the control raw sequencing file matching the file ENCFF002AAU.fastq.gz ?
c. Assume the "controlled.by" field on the data portal, or metadata.tsv or the file json did not exist. (As was the case when this question was originally written). Assume you have downloaded all the chip-seq raw files, and now want to know which file is control for which. Write a script that looks up each file's experiment's controls experiment's files to identify the control files. Watch out for the replicate structure.
